# 👋 Hi, I'm Deva Vishnu

Mechanical Engineering undergraduate focused on building strong fundamentals in design, analysis, and software.

This GitHub profile documents my learning journey, practice work, and technical growth over time.

## 👤 About Me

I am a Mechanical Engineering student who believes engineering should not remain limited to a single domain.

My main focus is to build a strong foundation in mechanical engineering while also developing software skills that support modern engineering systems. I am interested in understanding how things work both physically and digitally, from mechanical components and structures to code, logic, and computational thinking.

I work with design tools such as AutoCAD and Fusion 360 to create and understand engineering drawings and 3D models. I am currently learning ANSYS to strengthen my knowledge of structural and analysis concepts. Alongside core mechanical subjects, I am studying programming fundamentals using C and Python to improve problem-solving ability and logical reasoning.

I prefer learning concepts clearly rather than rushing through topics. I believe consistency, discipline, and daily effort matter more than short-term motivation. My goal is to gradually build skills that compound over time.

This GitHub space represents my progress, learning experiments, and future projects. It is a record of growth rather than perfection.
